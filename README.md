A Whistly Floppy Bird
=========
This is a massacre of [nebez floppy bird]https://github.com/nebez/floppybird and
[cwilso's](https://github.com/cwilso) [PitchDetect](https://github.com/cwilso/PitchDetect)
and [volume-meter](https://github.com/cwilso/volume-meter).

Whistle to control the floppy bird. Higher pitch means more acceleration.
